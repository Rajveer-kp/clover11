# TEAM MEMBERS COUNT - FIXED! ✅

## Problem
The team members count was showing 0 even when editors had accepted invitations.

## Root Cause
The original logic was incorrectly counting only editors who had both:
1. ✅ Accepted invitations AND
2. ❌ Active YouTube connections

But **editors don't need YouTube connections** - only creators do! Editors just upload videos to the creator's YouTube account through the creator's connection.

## Fix Applied

### Before (Incorrect Logic):
```python
# Count only editors with active YouTube connections
team_members = 0
for invitation in accepted_invitations:
    if invitation.editor.youtube_connected:  # ❌ Wrong requirement
        team_members += 1
```

### After (Correct Logic):
```python
# Count all editors with accepted invitations (editors don't need YouTube connections)
team_members = len(accepted_invitations)  # ✅ Correct
```

## Test Results

### Before Fix:
- All creators showed **0 team members** (even with accepted invitations)

### After Fix:
- **rajveerkharade@gmail.com**: Shows **2 team members** ✅
- **Other creators**: Show **0 team members** ✅ (correct, no accepted invitations)

## Template Update
Also updated the description from "Active editors" to "Accepted editors" to be more accurate.

## Files Modified
- `app/routes/views.py` - Fixed team member counting logic
- `app/templates/creator_dashboard.html` - Updated description text

## Status: RESOLVED ✅
Team members count now correctly shows the number of editors who have accepted invitations, regardless of their YouTube connection status (which is the correct behavior).
