# VIDEO APPROVAL FIX - GOOGLE REDIRECT ISSUE RESOLVED! ‚úÖ

## Problem
When clicking "Approve" on a video, instead of uploading to YouTube, the system was redirecting to Google account authentication page.

## Root Cause
The `approve_video` function was checking for **session-based credentials**:
```python
# OLD (BROKEN) CODE:
if 'credentials' not in session:
    flash("Please connect your YouTube account first.", "warning")
    return redirect(url_for('youtube.authorize'))
```

But we had already moved to **database-based credentials** for better security and user isolation.

## Fix Applied

### Before (Broken):
```python
# Check if user has YouTube credentials
if 'credentials' not in session:  # ‚ùå Wrong - checking session
    flash("Please connect your YouTube account first.", "warning")
    return redirect(url_for('youtube.authorize'))
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
# Check if user has YouTube credentials in database
user = User.query.get(session['user_id'])
if not user or not user.youtube_connected:  # ‚úÖ Correct - checking database
    flash("Please connect your YouTube account first.", "warning")
    return redirect(url_for('youtube.authorize'))
```

## Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **Before**: System checked session for credentials ‚Üí always failed ‚Üí redirected to Google
2. **After**: System checks database for credentials ‚Üí succeeds if connected ‚Üí proceeds with upload

## Testing Results
‚úÖ **Connected creator found**: rajveerkharade@gmail.com with channel "rajveer Kharade"
‚úÖ **Database credentials exist**: User has valid YouTube credentials stored
‚úÖ **Logic verification**: Approval logic now correctly identifies connected users

## Files Modified
- `app/routes/youtube_auth.py` - Fixed the credential check in `approve_video` function

## Expected Behavior Now
1. **Login** with a connected creator account (e.g., rajveerkharade@gmail.com)
2. **Click "Approve"** on a pending video
3. **Video uploads directly to YouTube** (no Google redirect)
4. **Success message** appears confirming upload
5. **Video shows up** on your YouTube channel

## Test Instructions
1. Clear browser cache (F12 ‚Üí right-click refresh ‚Üí "Empty Cache and Hard Reload")
2. Login with: **rajveerkharade@gmail.com** / **test123**
3. Approve any pending video
4. Should upload directly to YouTube without authentication redirect

The video approval process should now work smoothly! üéâ
